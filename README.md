This project is about recreating the Android Whatsapp application with Vue and Vuetify. Android Whatsapp follows Material Design(<https://material.io/design/>), Vuetify happens to follow the same design specification. This means that you should be able to achieve a similar visual feel without introducing too much custom styling.
